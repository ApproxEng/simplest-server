# Simplest Server

This is about as simple as it's possible to make a fully functional Python web server. It uses
Flask and GEvent, returns a single bit of static HTML and shows how the server can receive and
handle URL parameters. Hacked up quickly during a Raspberry Pi Pioneers session to allow one of
the teams to control their USB missile launcher from a web page.
